# Getting Started

This guide is currently being developed.  If you are comfortable with cloning this repo and running Cargo / executing a Makefile, it should be fairly straightforward -- having said that, __straightforward__ is a completely subjective and potentially unhelpful (or even discouraging) term to use.  This guide should be inclusive to all backgrounds with a bias of going overboard on helping someone new to Rust and Git get started (even as prerequisites).  To that end, if you have experience with Docker, this [development environment](https://github.com/chrmi/dev) may help to get the foundations installed (or at least read through how they can be installed locally).  Note this tool is general use and has many, many more tools installed than are necessary for this project; but they don't hurt to have, and as they are within a container, having these extras installed has no impact on your local machine beyond additional storage within the container.

If you are new to Rust or could use a refresher, start with the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).  There is also an official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) which can be read entirely online.

This project will likely require expert level Git experience to contribute to the core logic; however, this expertise is not required to [start contributing](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  This section should include in-depth links and tutorials to learning the ins and outs of Git (for the code) as well as GitHub (for interacting with the project).

Finally, this section should contain "Hello, World" steps once the required tools are installed.  For now, see the [README.md](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/blob/main/README.md) and [Makefile](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/blob/main/Makefile).

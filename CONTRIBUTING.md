# Contributing

chowndn is an open source project.

This project is currently VAPORWARE! To get this going, we need your help.

## Before filing an issue

* Take a look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/issues).  An existing issue may be close enough to expand, helping refine and bring attention to an overall goal.
* Consider if your proposal is a feature, tech debt, or suggestion, and file accordingly.  Miscategorised issues take time way from other work.

## Filing issues
Initially, we need discussions and a plan to implement.  Before creating issues on implementing, start with the [Discussions](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/discussions). 

To get started with the code as is, first see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md).  This will outline the specifics needed to install Rust and related tools, build, and start exploring.  If you're having trouble getting the repo running, start by either replying to the [Getting Started thread](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/discussions/11) on the GitHub Discussions, or send a note to [@chrmi](https://tech.lgbt/@chrmi) on Mastodon with the hashtag `#chowndn`.

If you've tried reaching out to others and there seems to be a genuine issue, make sure to include the following details.  Even if you intend to submit a PR to fix said issue, it's very helpful to create a GitHub Issue so we can track progress and possibly identify other gaps in the onboarding process. 

1. What version of Rust are you using (`rustc --version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What steps from the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) did you take, which one are you not able to proceed to?
4. What is the command line output at point of failure? 
5. We all come from diverse backgrounds and have a range of experience with Rust, Git, and software development; this project aims to cater to these broad experiences from seasoned Rust systems engineers, to first-time systems programmers.  With this in mind, what would have helped enable you to troubleshoot further before creating an issue?  Where could the docs be expanded?

For change proposals, create a thread within the Idea category on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/chrmi/chowndn/discussions/). 

Finally, thank you!  This project is primarily a means to build community within the Rust and transgender communities.  Even by learning about this project, you've already taken a step to sharing technical and social awareness in these communities, and who knows who you might mention it to and where that conversation could lead.  Please don't feel shy about reaching out!
